  </div>
  <div class="empty-div"></div>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h2>
  <div class="casewrap">
    <p>Busy professionals often spend long workdays on computers. We know taking a break
    and getting fresh air is good for us, but how often does that really happen? Blink uses nudge
    theory to keep our eyes healthy and happy through better habits.</p>
  </div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Problem</h2>
<div class="casewrap">
  <p>Humans naturally blink around 15 times a minute. Blinking keeps our eyes lubricated and prevents painful
  conditions related to dry eyes. With the advent of screens, that number drops to around 5 times a minute. What
is tragic is that adults are not alone. Children as young as 7 are being diagnosed with eye conditions
typically seen by adults in their 50's. </p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Users & Audience</h2>
<div class="casewrap">
  <p>Our ideal user is a professional who uses computers throughout the day. However, due to
  the prevelance of screens in daily life, anyone who spends a lot of time on their phone
is also an ideal candidate for Blink. People who suffer from dry eye symptoms can benefit the most from
Blink. These users may have an official diagnosis from their doctor or may be coping on their own.</p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
<div class="casewrap">
  <p>
The development team consisted of Erin Soggs, Inès Belghiti, and me, Alex Holder.
Erin and Inès focused on the back-end development while I worked hand in hand with a
more experienced UI designer to conceptualize the visuals. Inès managed
the product backlog using Trello and acted as product manager. I developed the
wireframes in various fidelity levels and then worked on prototyping our mockups.
After we tested our prototypes with volunteers, I worked on the front-end development.
I also worked extensively on the presentation of Blink for our product pitch.
  </p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Scope & Constraints</h2>
<div class="casewrap">
  <p>
The scope was limited to creating an MVP within two weeks for Le Wagon Montréal's Demo Day. This
web app was made from scratch based on an initial pitch by Erin Soggs.

    We started by defining our problem. Once we had an idea of what we were trying to solve,
    we had to narrow our focus on what the minimum viable product would entail. We
    narrowed in on a persona. We came up with a user journey map based on our persona
    using Blink throughout their day. We performed a card sort exercise to ideate different
    features that Blink could have. Once we arrived at a consensus, we put together paper
    wireframes. These were converted into lo-fi wireframes on Figma. I then worked on
    various designs that evolved into a hi-fi mockup. We prototyped this mockup and tested it
    with volunteers. Meanwhile, our team had started developing the back-end of this web app.
    Once we were happy with the prototype, I worked on the front-end development.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Outcomes & What I Learned</h2>

This was a very time-constrained project but it forced our team to focus on the most
important work to be done each day. I learned how to take design feedback and accomodate for
different styles. I learned the importance of relying on teammates for input and assistance. We presented
this web app to a crowd of 50+ people and it was an instant hit. People related to the pain
caused by dry eyes and too much screen time. They see it as a solution to a growing problem.
Blink reminds users to take a break from staring at the screen every 20 minutes and even offers
suggestions of what to do with that newfound free time. It also features eye exercises that can
train your brain to blink at a biologically appropriate rate.
